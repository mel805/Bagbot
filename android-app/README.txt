Android app (native) - BAG Bot Manager

This is a native Android app (Jetpack Compose) that controls the bot via the dashboard API.
It uses Discord OAuth2 via the dashboard server (not inside WebView) and receives a mobile Bearer token.

Build in CI will produce a debug APK and attach it to GitHub Releases.
